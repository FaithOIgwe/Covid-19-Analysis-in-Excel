# Covid-19-Analysis-in-Excel
Using the data collected from Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, I carried out an exploratory analysis of Covid-19 Mortality from 2020-2022.

**Introduction**
One would think that 2 years after the first strain of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) was discovered in 2019, that the mortality would have reached an all time low but instead the reverse has been the case with over a million tragic deaths 2022, making it the highest mortality rate since it was discovered.
 While methods have been put in place, to curb the spread of this deadly virus, why is there still a spike? Which countries are mostly affected and why? Continents mosty affected, who are the High-risk individuals that die from this Disease, which countries and continents have the least mortality and why?
 All of this guided my analysis to further more understand why there is a spike in cases in 2022.
 
 **Problem Statement**
 1. How many deaths have been recorded between 2020- 2020?
 2. Which year had the most deaths and why?
 3. Which Continents have recorded the most deaths?
 4. Which Continents have recorded the least deaths so far and how have they been able to do that?
 5. Where are the High-Risk Countries?
 6. Recommendations and Findings.
